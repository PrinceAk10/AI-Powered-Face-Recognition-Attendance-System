🏗️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries & Frameworks: OpenCV, dlib, Face Recognition, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Pandas

Database: SQLite / MySQL

Frontend: Tkinter / Streamlit

API Integration: Twilio API (for notifications), Google Photos API (optional for face dataset management)

🚀 Installation & Setup

Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from here.

Step 1: Clone the Repository

🖼️ How It Works

The system captures real-time video from the webcam.

It detects and recognizes faces using deep learning models.

If a recognized face matches a registered user, attendance is marked.

The record is stored in the database with timestamps.

Optional: Sends notifications via Twilio API (SMS/Email).

📌 Future Enhancements

Integration with RFID for multi-factor authentication.

Cloud storage support for attendance logs.

Mobile app for real-time attendance monitoring.

Advanced analytics for attendance trends.
