# AI-Powered-Face-Recognition-Attendance-System

# Overview

The AI-Powered Face Recognition Attendance System is an advanced solution that automates attendance tracking using facial recognition technology. This system leverages deep learning models to identify and verify individuals in real time, reducing manual effort and enhancing security.

# Features

Face Detection & Recognition – Identifies and verifies individuals using AI.

Real-time Attendance Logging – Automatically marks attendance upon detection.

Secure & Reliable – Ensures accuracy with deep learning-based face matching.

Database Integration – Stores attendance records for easy access and reporting.

Multi-user Support – Recognizes multiple users in different environments.

GUI Interface – User-friendly interface for easy system operation.

# Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries & Frameworks: OpenCV, dlib, Face Recognition, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Pandas

Database: SQLite / MySQL

Frontend: Tkinter / Streamlit

API Integration: Twilio API (for notifications), Google Photos API (optional for face dataset management)

# Installation & Setup

Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from here.

Step 1: Clone the Repository


# How It Works

The system captures real-time video from the webcam.

It detects and recognizes faces using deep learning models.

If a recognized face matches a registered user, attendance is marked.

The record is stored in the database with timestamps.

Optional: Sends notifications via Twilio API (SMS/Email).

# Future Enhancements

Integration with RFID for multi-factor authentication.

Cloud storage support for attendance logs.

Mobile app for real-time attendance monitoring.

Advanced analytics for attendance trends.
